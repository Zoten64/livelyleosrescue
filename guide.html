                <h2>Habitat</h2>
                <img src="assets/images/leopard_gecko_guide_habitat.webp" alt="A leopard gecko on top of a leaf">
                <p>Creating an ideal habitat for a leopard gecko is essential for their well-being and overall health.
                    Leopard geckos, native to the arid regions of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of India, thrive in
                    captivity when their environment closely resembles their natural habitat.

                    For the enclosure, opt for a tank that is at least 20 gallons for one leopard gecko, providing
                    additional space for each additional gecko. A longer tank is preferable, as leopard geckos are
                    ground-dwelling creatures. Selecting the right substrate is crucial – reptile carpet, paper towels,
                    or a mix of eco earth and sand are suitable options. Avoid loose substrates like sand or gravel, as
                    they can pose a risk of impaction if ingested.

                    Incorporate multiple hiding spots within the terrarium, as leopard geckos are nocturnal and require
                    safe, dark places to rest during the day. Commercial hides or natural hiding spots using rocks and
                    logs work well. Maintain a temperature gradient within the enclosure, with a basking spot around
                    88-92°F (31-33°C) and a cooler side around 75-80°F (24-27°C). Utilize an under-tank heating pad or a
                    heat lamp to achieve these temperatures. While leopard geckos do not require UVB lighting, a
                    low-wattage light can simulate a day-night cycle.

                    Control humidity levels, keeping them low at 30-40%, as leopard geckos are adapted to arid
                    environments, and high humidity can lead to respiratory issues. Provide a shallow water dish for
                    hydration. Enhance the terrarium with decorations such as artificial plants, branches, and rocks for
                    visual appeal and enrichment. Ensure all decorations are securely positioned to prevent accidental
                    collapse.</p>

            <section id="diet" class="guide-section">
                <h2>Diet</h2>
                <img src="assets/images/leopard_gecko_guide_diet.jpg" alt="A hornworm on top of a plant">
                <p>Ensuring a proper diet is vital for the health and vitality of leopard geckos kept in captivity.
                    These insectivores thrive on a diverse range of live insects, including crickets, mealworms,
                    waxworms, hornworms and dubia roaches. To maintain a balanced nutritional intake, it's essential to
                    offer a
                    variety of these insects.

                    When it comes to feeding schedules, juvenile leopard geckos benefit from daily feedings to support
                    their rapid growth, while adult geckos can be fed every other day or three times a week. Adjust the
                    feeding frequency based on the age, size, and overall health of your gecko.

                    Gut loading the insects before feeding is a crucial step in ensuring nutritional value. This
                    involves providing the insects with nutrient-rich foods such as vegetables, fruits, and commercial
                    gut-loading products 24 hours before serving them to your gecko.

                    To prevent calcium deficiencies and metabolic bone disease, it's recommended to dust the insects
                    with a calcium supplement containing vitamin D3 at least twice a week. Additionally, a multivitamin
                    supplement can be introduced once a week for added nutritional variety.

                    In the terrarium, always provide a shallow dish of fresh water. While leopard geckos derive most of
                    their hydration from their food, access to water is still essential for their overall well-being.

                    Monitor your gecko's eating habits closely and adjust its diet as needed. Regular observation
                    ensures that your leopard gecko maintains a healthy weight and exhibits normal feeding behavior. By
                    adhering to these dietary guidelines, you contribute significantly to the longevity and well-being
                    of your leopard gecko in captivity.</p>

            <section id="handling" class="guide-section">
                <h2>Handling</h2>
                <img src="assets/images/leopard_gecko_guide_handling.jpeg" alt="A leopard gecko being held">
                <p>Handling a leopard gecko is a delicate process that requires patience and consideration for the
                    well-being of your pet. To start, allow your gecko to acclimate to its environment after any changes
                    or introductions. This initial period of adjustment helps reduce stress and establishes a sense of
                    security.

                    When it comes to handling, choose an appropriate time, preferably during the evening or night since
                    leopard geckos are nocturnal creatures. During these hours, they are generally more active and
                    alert, making them more receptive to interaction.

                    Approach your gecko with slow and gentle movements. Place your hand in the terrarium, allowing the
                    gecko to see and smell you. Avoid sudden or abrupt gestures that might startle the gecko. Gradually
                    coax the gecko onto your hand by placing it under its body and allowing it to crawl onto your palm
                    at its own pace.

                    Support the gecko's body properly while handling. They have delicate bodies and can be skittish, so
                    make sure to provide a secure and stable surface for them to walk on. Avoid grabbing or restraining
                    the gecko tightly, as this can cause stress and discomfort.

                    Keep handling sessions short and gradually increase the duration as your gecko becomes more
                    accustomed to it. Pay attention to their body language, if they show signs of stress, such as tail
                    waving or vocalizations, gently return them to their enclosure.

                    Remember that not all geckos enjoy handling, and individual preferences vary. Always respect your
                    gecko's boundaries and avoid forcing interaction. Over time, consistent and gentle handling can help
                    build trust and strengthen the bond between you and your leopard gecko.</p>
