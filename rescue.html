                <h3>Have you found a discarded leopard gecko?</h3>
                <p>If you have the ability to we encourage you to care for it yoursef. if you can't, check with friends
                    and family you know and trust to see if they have the ability to do so.
                    <br>

                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>What to do</h3>
                <p>You need to be incredibly careful when handling a leopard gecko. Do not grab it by the tail, simply
                    scoop it up under it's stomach. Do not grab it from the top as this will stress it out. Leopard
                    geckos are natural prey and picking them up that way is close to how a predator would catch them.
                </p>
                <p>Do not put it with any other leopard geckos. The little fella could carry disease. Put it
                    in quarantine and get it either to a shelter or veterinarian as soon as possible. If you don't have
                    any enclosure you can make a temporary one. Start by disinfecting a
                    plastic container and put some paper towels on the bottom. Make sure to have a lid with holes in it.
                    You do not want the leopard gecko to escape, especially not if you have other free roaming pets. Add
                    a heat source, preferably a heat mat if you have access to one. Make sure to also put in a hide of
                    some sor. An upside down box with a hole in it will do. </p>
                <p>Give it a little water dish. If you have food you know is safe for leopard geckos, try to give it
                    some of that. DO NOT give it random food or insects you've got as this may be toxic to the little
                    creature. A leopard gecko can survive for 10-14 days without food.</p>

                <p>Never release a domesticated animal back into the wild. They will most likely not survive and may
                    even do damage to the local eco system.</p>

                <h3>Are you no longer able to care for your leopard gecko?</h3>
                <p>The most responsible thing you can do, no matter how hard it might be, is to rehome them. Ask family
                    and friends if they can care for it and make sure that they have all the tools and knowledge needed.
                    Alternatively you can sell it to someone who knows how to care for the little critter.
