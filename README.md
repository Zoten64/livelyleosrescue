# Lively Leos
## A rescue for leopard geckos

Livelyleos is a rescue dedicated to leopard geckos. Not only do they rehome these reptiles, but they also make sure that they are safe and sound in their new home, provide guides and education for stores and employees on how to properly keep the little creatures as pet stores tend to have enclosures that are way to small as well as dangeround substrate. Livelyleos main pitches are their guides, adoptions and rescues, taking in both abandoned pets as well as those that can't be kept anymore for various reasons such as financial trouble, floodings, busy owners and more. Livelyleos provide veterinary care to these unfortunate lizards in order to make sure they're healthy once they get to their new owners.

The rescue is made up from volunteers who are passionate about the well being of these geckos, including veterinarians and long time owners.
