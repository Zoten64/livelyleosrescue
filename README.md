# Lively Leos
## A rescue for leopard geckos

Livelyleos is a rescue dedicated to leopard geckos. Not only do they rehome these reptiles, but they also make sure that they are safe and sound in their new home, provide guides and education for stores and employees on how to properly keep the little creatures as pet stores tend to have enclosures that are way to small as well as dangeround substrate. Livelyleos main pitches are their guides, adoptions and rescues, taking in both abandoned pets as well as those that can't be kept anymore for various reasons such as financial trouble, floodings, busy owners and more. Livelyleos provide veterinary care to these unfortunate lizards in order to make sure they're healthy once they get to their new owners.

The rescue is made up from volunteers who are passionate about the well being of these geckos, including veterinarians and long time owners.

## Goals and target audience

The goal of the project was to make a website that is useful for both new leopard gecko owners and long time ones as well as showing off the leopard geckos for those looking to adopt one. Another goal that I developed later was to provide a seperate page dedicated to rescue info and a form where you can contact the rescue for help/sending the gecko to them. 

I wanted to make the website both simple, not overwhelming and easy on the eyes as well as accessible to those with visual impairments and those who use keyboards to navigate. The website features easy to digest info about care and encourages the user to do more research on the topic as well. 

The target audience is very obvious. It's for those looking to adopt a leopard gecko or looking for a rescue to hand a leopard gecko over to. 

## Design

For the design I wanted to implement both a light mode and a dark mode for the site. I visited [Happy Hues](https://www.happyhues.co/) for a color pallette. What I did was I chose [this pallette](https://www.happyhues.co/palettes/9) and modified it slightly. I removed the pink color and kept the rest. For dark mode i took the colors from [this pallette](https://www.happyhues.co/palettes/13), but removed the accent colors to keep the same orange as light mode. I ended up changing the accent color from #ff8e3c to #bb3e1f (Current color that you see in the pallette) to make it contrast more with the text for better visibility.

**Light mode color pallette:**

**Dark mode color pallette**

For the design and layout I took inspiration from [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0db5kA4BfQ&list=PL1abJ21nmMp82I9AUCc0ZKEe5NVgNyWGt&index=1&t=177s).

The font used on the whole page was [Roboto from google fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
